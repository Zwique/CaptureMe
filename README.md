# üì∏ Cybersecurity Photo Capture App

This is a **cybersecurity-focused web application** built using **Flask**, designed to allow anyone to capture photos of users directly from their mobile devices and securely upload them to a server. The app leverages **Ngrok** for secure tunneling, exposing the local server to the public internet via an encrypted tunnel. Additionally, **QR codes** are generated for easy access to the public URL, making the app both secure and convenient to use.

This project serves as an example of how to handle **secure file uploads** and **remote access** within a web application, with a focus on **data security** and **privacy**.

## üî• Features  
- **Mobile Photo Capture** ‚Äì Take photos using a device's camera and upload secretly.  
- **Ngrok Secure Tunneling** ‚Äì Expose your local server via an encrypted public URL.  
- **QR Code Access** ‚Äì Auto-generated QR code for instant mobile connectivity.  
- **Secure Uploads** ‚Äì Only allows JPG/PNG files with incremental filenames (e.g., `captured_photo1.jpg`).  
- **Local Storage** ‚Äì Files saved in `/photos` (no cloud dependency).  

## üöÄ Quick Start  


### Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zwique/CaptureMe.git
   cd cybersecurity-photo-capture-app
   ```
2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```
### Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

3. **Install Ngrok**:
   - Ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to your local development environment, making your Flask app accessible over the internet. It is required to expose the local Flask server to the outside world.
   - You can download and install Ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - The Python dependencies for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. **Run:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
6. **Access**:
   - Scan the QR code on your phone to open the app. Then, grant the necessary permissions to allow the app to capture a photo using your phone's front camera.
8. **Check Saved Photos**:
   - Once a photo is captured, it will be uploaded to the server and saved in the photos/ directory with an incremented filename (e.g., captured_photo1.jpg, captured_photo2.jpg, etc.).
